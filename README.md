# ðŸš— Parkingâ€‘Lot Monitoring with YOLOv8 + Flask

A lightweight web application that uses **YOLOv8** object detection to track vehicle occupancy in a parking lot, streams the annotated video in realâ€‘time, and displays the number of available spaces on screen.

## ðŸŽ¯ Features

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Realâ€‘time detection** | Runs YOLOv8 (`yolov8s.pt`) on each video frame to identify cars, trucks, buses, bikes, etc. |
| **Parkingâ€‘space status** | Dynamically defined polygons mark each parking spot; the app shows **green** (free) or **red** (occupied) outlines and counts available spots. |
| **Live MJPEG stream** | Frames are encoded as JPEG and served via Flask at `/video_feed`, enabling seamless playback in any browser. |
| **Simple UI** | Oneâ€‘page HTML (Jinja2 template) with **Start / Stop** controls, custom CSS, and a tiny vanillaâ€‘JS helper script. |
